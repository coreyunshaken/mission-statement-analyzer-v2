"Good morning everyone, and thank you for investing your time in this critical strategic session. 

Over the next three hours, we're going to create a mission statement that drives real business results for our organization. We're using the same methodology that Fortune 500 companies pay $15,000+ for, based on analysis of over 500 top-performing companies and academic research from Harvard Business School and Wharton.

Before we begin, let me share what we know about mission statements that work versus those that don't..."

"Your current mission [if applicable] scores X points and ranks #Y in your industry. Today, we're going to create a mission that scores 80+ points and puts you in the top 25% of organizations.

The key to our success today is collaboration and honest input. There are no wrong ideas during brainstorming, and every perspective in this room matters. 

Let's start with introductions..."
