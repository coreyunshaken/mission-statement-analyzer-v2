What If Monopoly Money Could Transform Your Entire Culture?
How to create lasting culture change without waiting for budget approval

What if I told you the most powerful recognition program I ever implemented cost less than a fast-food meal and used fake money from a board game?

You'd probably think I'd lost my mind. Trust me, I had moments where I wondered the same thing.

Every leadership book I'd read told me that meaningful recognition requires significant investment. HR departments demand elaborate approval processes. Corporate policies insist on "appropriate" monetary awards that require three signatures and a budget code.

But here's what 3000 employees taught me that no MBA program ever would: the money was never the point.

The Recognition Theater Most Leaders Are Trapped In

When I took command of a large military logistics operation, we had what every organization has: a "robust" recognition program.

We had just completed an organizational survey. The results? Let's just say we had nowhere to go but up.

Someone would submit paperwork for a monetary spot award. A department head would approve it. HR would process it. Eventually, maybe, the employee would get a notice in their paycheck stub.

Sound familiar?

The system checked all the boxes. It was fair, documented, and properly budgeted. It was also completely worthless.

One employee told me later, "Colonel, I got a spot award once and didn't even know what I'd done to earn it." That's when I knew we had a connection problem, not a money problem.

The Monopoly Money Experiment (And My Doubts)

I wanted recognition that was spontaneous, impactful, and actually connected to our mission. So I threw out the playbook and tried something that would probably get me fired in most organizations.

I bought a set of Monopoly money.

Honestly? I wasn't sure this wouldn't backfire completely. What if employees thought it was insulting? What if other commanders thought I'd lost it?

Here's how it worked: Anyone could nominate someone for going above and beyond. No forms, no approvals, just "Hey, Sarah did something amazing." A diverse board of leaders would evaluate the nomination weekly. If approved, here's where the magic happened.

I would gather the entire chain of command—every leader between me and that employee. We'd walk together from my office to wherever that person worked. No advance notice. No scheduling. We just showed up.

Picture this: A colonel and six other leaders suddenly appearing at your workstation. Your first thought? "What did I do wrong?"

The anxiety was visible. Conversations stopped. Everyone within fifty yards was suddenly very interested in what was about to happen.

The Moment Everything Changed

The nominating leader would speak first, explaining to the employee—and everyone listening—exactly what they'd done and why it mattered. Then I'd connect their actions to our mission: keeping service members safe and equipped.

Nine times out of ten, they'd start to tear up.

One employee actually said, "Colonel, I thought I was getting fired!" before breaking into tears when she realized we were there to thank her for catching a critical error that could have left troops without essential equipment.

The hand-written colonel's note and the Monopoly money ($100, $250, or $500 that would appear in their next paycheck) came last. But here's what surprised me most: when I asked employees about the recognition afterward, they were grateful for the money, but what they remembered was the moment.

Most told me the experience would have been exactly the same impact without any money at all.

The Ripple Effect You Can't Budget For

The real transformation didn't happen with the person we recognized. It happened with the other 50 to 100 employees who witnessed it.

After about six months of doing this weekly, people knew what it meant when they saw me walking with a group of leaders. Someone was about to have their day made. Conversations would start: "Did you see what happened?" "I wonder what she did?" "Maybe I should step up too."

The change wasn't linear—it was exponential. The more people we recognized, the more behaviors worth recognizing we discovered.

But let me be clear: this recognition program was just one piece of a larger transformation effort. It didn't single-handedly change our culture, but it was a crucial element that connected everything else we were doing.

Human behavior 101: we all want to be recognized. But more than that, we want to matter. We want to know that our work connects to something bigger than a paycheck.

The Permission You've Been Waiting For

You don't need budget approval to transform your culture.

I work with senior executives now, and they face the same opportunity. The difference? Too many are more concerned about their bonus than building a recognition program that actually works.

Yes, some HR departments will hate this approach. Some bosses will think it's unprofessional. Do it anyway. Ask forgiveness, not permission.

Your employees don't want expensive gifts. They want to know they matter. They want to see that their daily contributions add up to something meaningful.

The most powerful recognition isn't what you give—it's what you give up. Your time. Your attention. Your willingness to show up where they are and say, "What you do matters."

Your Monday Morning Game Plan

Here's what you can implement this week without asking anyone's permission:

This Week: Start a simple nomination system. Email, Slack, sticky notes—whatever works. Ask people to tell you when someone goes above and beyond.

This Month: Create your recognition moments. Walk to their workspace. Bring witnesses. Make it public. Connect their actions to your organization's mission. (Adapt this to your reality—maybe it's you and two department heads instead of seven leaders.)

This Quarter: Watch the culture shift. People will start doing things worthy of recognition not for the reward, but for the moment of being seen and valued.

The biggest obstacle? Your own hesitation to try something that seems too simple to work.

Cultural change doesn't happen overnight. It requires time, connection, and leader buy-in. But it starts with one person willing to walk across the building and say someone matters.

The Real ROI of Fake Money

What started as an experiment with game pieces became one of the most effective elements of our culture transformation. Our survey scores improved dramatically over the following year.

Not because Monopoly money is magic, but because showing up is.

Your people are watching to see if you actually care or if you're just managing metrics. Every time you choose convenience over connection, you're telling them where your priorities really are.

The recognition program that helped change everything didn't require new policies, additional funding, or executive approval. It required a leader willing to walk across the building, interrupt someone's day, and say "You matter."

What's stopping you from trying something that simple?
