# CONTENT-CLAUDE.md - Corey's Substack Writing System

This file captures proven patterns from my Substack performance data for The Unshaken Leader.

## Quick Start
When I say "new article about [topic]", immediately:
1. Run Raw-to-Rich V2.0 process (20 min discovery)
2. Apply Master Prompt V6 with data-driven optimizations below
3. Prioritize patterns that have proven 60%+ open rates

## My Proven Title Formulas (Based on Actual Performance)

### 🏆 Top Performers (Use These First!)
1. **"What If..." Pattern** (73% avg open rate)
   - "What If Your LinkedIn Told the Truth?" - 73%
   - "What If Your Greatest Leadership Strength..." - 51%
   - "What If Your Greatest Struggles Are..." - 58%

2. **"Tell Me/Show Me" Direct Challenge** (73% open rate)
   - "Tell Me What I Need to Know" - 73%
   - Creates immediate engagement through direct address

3. **"How I..." Personal Journey** (60%+ open rates)
   - "How I Escaped the Golden Prison of External Success" - 60%
   - Personal vulnerability + specific transformation

4. **"The Truth About..." Revelation** (43-63% range)
   - "The Painful Truth About Succeeding" - 63%
   - "The Truth About Strategic Leader Abdication" - 43%

5. **"What [Specific Experience] Taught Me"** (64% open rate)
   - "What Leading Thousands Taught Me" - 64%
   - Specific credibility + lesson learned

### ⚠️ Patterns to Avoid (Lower Performance)
- Generic "Strategic Planning" without hook - 49%
- Abstract concepts without personal angle - 43%
- Welcome/Introduction emails - 20% (expected)

## My Voice Signature
- Military experience: "826 soldiers", "combat to conference room"
- Vulnerability markers: "shadow", "prison", "escape", "painful truth"
- Direct challenge: "Tell me", "What if", questioning assumptions
- Transformation focus: "shifted", "transformed", "evolved"

## Content Themes That Resonate

### High Engagement Topics (Based on Views)
1. **Personal Transformation Stories** (avg 150+ views)
   - "How I Escaped the Golden Prison" - 194 views
   - "My Shadow" work - 133 views

2. **Leadership Contradictions** (avg 110+ views)
   - LinkedIn truth vs. reality
   - External success vs. internal struggle
   - What you're told vs. what works

3. **Direct Assessments/Frameworks** (avg 111+ views)
   - Self-Leadership Assessment - 111 views
   - Decision Frameworks - 102 views

## My Engagement Metrics Benchmarks

### Current Performance Levels
- **Baseline Open Rate**: 45-50%
- **Good Open Rate**: 55-60%
- **Excellent Open Rate**: 60-70%
- **Exceptional**: 70%+ (aim for "What If" and "Tell Me" patterns)

### Engagement Indicators
- Comments (0-10 range, with 6 being exceptional)
- Email replies (track which topics generate DMs)
- Newsletter responses to "thank you" emails: 67-86% open rates

## Article Structure That Works

### Opening Patterns (from top performers)
1. Start with contradiction or uncomfortable truth
2. Include military-specific credibility early (first 200 words)
3. Use "What if" or "Imagine" to create immediate engagement

### Vulnerability Placement
- Early vulnerability (first 1/3) correlates with higher engagement
- Specific struggles > generic challenges
- Name the cost: marriage, health, sanity references perform well

### Closing Patterns
- Permission-giving ("You don't have to...")
- Direct challenge ("Tell me what you need")
- Transformation possibility ("What if your greatest struggle...")

## Production Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery (20 min)
Use Raw-to-Rich V2.0:
- Focus on contradictions between military and corporate
- Look for "golden prison" moments (external success, internal struggle)
- Find the "what if" angle in any frustration

### Phase 2: Production (45-60 min)
Use Master Prompt V6 with these data-driven adjustments:
- Prioritize "What If" titles for 70%+ open rate potential
- Include military credibility marker in first 200 words
- Use vulnerability early (proven engagement driver)
- End with permission or direct challenge

### Phase 3: Optimization
Before publishing, check:
- [ ] Title uses proven pattern (What If, Truth About, How I, Tell Me)
- [ ] Military credibility established early
- [ ] Vulnerability included in first third
- [ ] Specific numbers/details included (not generic)
- [ ] Contradiction or challenge to conventional wisdom clear

## Monthly Performance Review

Track these metrics:
1. Open rate by title pattern
2. Engagement (comments + replies) by topic
3. Which vulnerability types generate most response
4. View count correlation with title structure

## Testing Queue (Based on Data)

High-Confidence Tests:
1. More "What If" titles - proven 73% open rate
2. "Tell Me" direct challenges - proven 73% open rate
3. Shadow/darkness themes - high engagement
4. Golden prison metaphors - strong performance

## Integration with Claude Desktop + Notion

When starting new article:
1. Reference this CONTENT-CLAUDE.md for patterns
2. Check Notion database for similar past topics
3. Apply highest-performing title pattern for topic type
4. Track new article performance back to Notion

## Never Forget

My readers want:
- Permission to be human while leading
- Validation that struggle doesn't mean failure
- Practical frameworks from someone who's been there
- Truth about the costs of success
- Alternative paths to conventional wisdom

My unique value:
- 826 soldiers leadership experience
- Corporate transition vulnerability
- Shadow work + leadership integration
- Permission-giving for exhausted leaders
- Bridge between warrior and executive
