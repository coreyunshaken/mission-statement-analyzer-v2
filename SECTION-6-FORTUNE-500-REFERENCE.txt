- Professional executive design matching the rest of the playbook
- Create visual groupings by industry sector
- Use corporate colors or icons for each industry if possible
- Make the mission statements stand out (perhaps in quote boxes or cards)
- Keep the clean, Fortune 500 consulting look
- Add subtle visual elements to separate industries
- Format the Workshop Application Guide as a practical reference tool
- Make "Your Mission Development Notes" section look like a worksheet

The goal is to provide inspirational reference material that executives can easily scan during their workshop.
